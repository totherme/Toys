* Learning Haskell Libraries

This repository contains a number of exercises with which I have been
learning or re-learning a number of libraries. For each library I
wanted to play with, I created a branch. You can follow my little
discoveries in the commit history of each branch.

** Parsec
   The first library I played with was Parsec. You can track my
   progres in the branch "LearningParsec".

   My exercise was to build a simple lisp parser, which you can see in
   the directory [[file:LispParser][LispParser]].

** QuickCheck
   Next up was the standard go-to for haskell quality control. You can
   track progress in the branch "LearningQuickcheck".

   My first exercise here was to test the [[file:LispParser][LispParser]] I started as a
   Parsec exercise.
