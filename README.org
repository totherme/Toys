* Learning Haskell Libraries

This repository contains a number of exercises with which I have been
learning or re-learning a number of libraries. For each library I
wanted to play with, I created a branch. You can follow my little
discoveries in the commit history of each branch.

** Parsec
   The first library I played with was Parsec. You can track my
   progres in the branch "LearningParsec".
